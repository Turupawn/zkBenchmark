# Filosofía Código's zkBenchmarking

This repository holds my personal journey through benchmarking major Zero-Knowledge projects.

**A Note:** ZK benchmarking is a multidimensial open-ended question. There’s no _"best project"_. Instead, projects may offer advantages like faster provers, or faster and cheaper verifiers, some might be application-specific and other general purpose. Moreover, ZK projects often vary in their architectural structures, developer experience and long term vision.

### A Living Work

Consider this repository as a **living work in progress**, ZK is moving fast.

### Features

- **Reproducible Benchmarks:** Each benchmark is meant to be easily reproduced through of GitHub Actions.
- **Starter Scripts:** The included scripts serve as a guide to help you get started with the tool of your choice.
- **zkVMs tests now live:** zkDSLs benchmarks coming soon™.
